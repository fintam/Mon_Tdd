This seminar is about practicing Test Driven Design and putting yourself into situations to succeed at pair programming.

# Bible of TDD
RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
# Techniques for better TDD

## Pair Programming
Pair programming really encourages the bible

## Typing Speed
TDD, whether alone or with a partner, is a long conversation.  Keeping up with that conversation so you don't lose the convo is important.

## Pain Driven Development
It is important to know when it is ok to refactor your code in TDD.  When you are feeling some "pain" with the current code you have,
it is probably time to develop.  If you are having a hard time finding that pain, if you are repeating something 3 times, it is probably time.
Important to note, 2 times does not indicate a problem.
